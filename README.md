## [Final Project: Personal Website ðŸ“‚](https://www.codedex.io/css/final-project)
Welcome to the final project for the CSS course! ðŸŒ²

It's time to express yourself using everything you learned about HTML and CSS and build your own personal site!

Along your programming journey, you'll find that building and maintaining a personal website is an invaluable tool! These usually include the following:

- An "About" section with a short paragraph describing the person who built the portfolio site, that may include a picture of them.
- A "Projects" or "Work" section that showcases your awesome projects and includes a link to the source code (and perhaps one for a demo).
- A "Contact" section that includes ways for someone to contact that person who built the portfolio site (e.g., forms for email sign-up, links to social media).
While this project will focus on styling with CSS, you will still need HTML. Here is some starter code for an index.html file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Personal Site</title>
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
  <header>
  </header>
  <main>
  </main>
  <footer>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
Feel free to modify the HTML as you see fit.

For the CSS, create a styles.css file and make sure to include what we learned throughout this course:

- Writing CSS styles, including selectors with declarations.
- Using common properties related to color, size, font, text alignment, and background.
- Working with a given element's box model by modifying their width/height, border, padding, and margin.
- Laying out elements on the page according to how they're displayed and positioned.
